<h1>What is VEGA?</h1>

**VEGA** is a **web vulnerability scanning tool** used to keep websites and web applications secure by finding vulnerabilities. It works by scanning the site, detecting issues like **SQL injection** and **cross-site scripting**, and reporting these vulnerabilities. **VEGA** automates the process of finding security weaknesses, saving time and effort. As an open-source tool, it‚Äôs free to use and can be customized to meet specific needs. Overall, **VEGA** helps developers fix security issues before hackers can exploit them.

**Task 1: Project Introduction and Overview of SOW.**

A) Open Google on your terminal, and then find, open, and read the **(SOW) Statement of Work**.![Vega Sat 2](https://github.com/TDCybersecurity/VEGA-Web-Application-Scanner/assets/142702123/259a91bd-882c-44a5-b530-d1143a76c61d)

What is a (SOW) Statement of Work?
**_A (SOW) Statement of Work_** _outlines the project‚Äôs scope, objectives, deliverables, and timelines for implementing a web vulnerability scan. This ensures everyone involved understands the project requirements, leading to better planning, execution, and accountability._

**Review the sections of the (SOW) Statement of Work**:

| 1 Introduction | 2 Background | 3 Scope | 4 Tasks, Deliverables, & Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 Reporting and Communication | 6 Work Performance | 7 Acceptance Criteria and Payment |     |

_Conducting a web vulnerability scan without a (SOW) Statement of Work can lead to several potential issues and risks, both legal and operational._

B) From the desktop open **VEGA**

| 3 OS Command Injection | Tests for the ability to **execute arbitrary commands on the server‚Äôs** operating system. This can give an attacker full **control over the server.** |
| 4 XPath Injection | Checks for **vulnerabilities in the use of XPath queries**, which can be manipulated to access **unauthorized parts of an XML document**. |
| 5 Blind SQL Injection | A variant of SQL injection that **does not directly reveal data** but can still be used to **infer information from the database** by analyzing server responses. |
| 6 (RFI) Remote File Inclusion | Tests for the ability to **include remote files in the server‚Äôs execution** context, which can be used to **execute arbitrary code.** |
| 7 (LFI) Local File Inclusion | Detects vulnerabilities that **allow local files to be included in the server‚Äôs execution** context, potentially leading to code execution or **information disclosure**. |
| 8 XML Injection | Looks for **weaknesses in XML processing** that could allow attackers to manipulate or disclose data by injecting malicious XML. |
| 9 HTTP Header Injection | Identifies vulnerabilities where an attacker can **inject malicious data into HTTP headers,** which can lead to various attacks, including **XSS and cache poisoning**. |
| 10 Format String Injection | Tests the format string vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or **cause a program crash by manipulating format string functions.** |

| 7 Information Disclosure | Detects **generic information disclosure vulnerabilities** in the content of HTTP responses, such as **debug information** or **internal paths**. |
| 8 Email Disclosure | Searches for **email addresses** in responses, which can be used for **social engineering** attacks. |
| 9 IP Address Disclosure | **Identifies IP addresses** disclosed in responses, which can be useful for **network** **mapping** and further attacks. |

**DISCUSSION**

(XSS) Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability commonly found in web applications.
Imagine visiting a website, and the website allows users to submit comments on a page.  Normally, you would expect these comments to just display text.  However, if the website is not careful about how it handles the comments, someone might submit a comment that includes malicious code instead of just text.

If someone sumbits a comment that includes a piece of JavaScript code, like: <script>alert(You have been hacked!);</script>, and the webiste does not check and sanitize the comment before displaying it, the code would run in the browser when you view the comment.

**IMPACT OF MALICIOUS CODE**

- Fake pop-up messages.
- Authentication and Personal login credentails can be stolen.
- Malicious code may be able to manipulate the content of the site, changing its appearance and/or function for another user.
- Getting redirected to a different website, potentially a dangerous website.
- Perform actions on your behalf without your permission.
- Script code can also obtain and retransmit cookie values if they haven‚Äôt been set HTTP only.

**REMEDIATION STEPS CAN INCLUDE**

- Sanitizing User Input: Ensure all user inuts are properly cleaned by escaping special characters.
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed.
- Valide Input: Validate all input data against a whitelist of allowed values to prevent malicious code.
- Escape Data on Output: Always escape data before rendering it in the browser, especially in HTML, JavaScript, and URLs.
- Use HTTP only and Secure Cookies: Set Cookies to HTTP only and Secure to prevent access via JavaScript and ensure secure transmission.
